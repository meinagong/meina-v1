          Well hello there! My name is Cassidy and I'm a Principal Developer Experience Engineer at
          <a
            href="https://www.netlify.com/?utm_source=cassidoowebsite&utm_medium=bio-cs&utm_campaign=devex-cs"
            >Netlify</a
          >. Before now, I worked at React Training, CodePen, Amazon, L4 Digital, Clarifai, and
          Venmo, and graduated from Iowa State University. <br />
          I run
          <a href="http://cassidoo.co/newsletter">a weekly newsletter</a> and love teaching and
          helping people become better coders! In my spare time, I love playing music, building
          mechanical keyboards and LEGO sets, and hanging out with
          <a href="https://twitter.com/cwillycs">my sister Cami</a>. I also have a
          <a href="https://www.patreon.com/cassidoo">Patreon</a> if you'd like to chat with me
          regularly (our Discord group is so active I can hardly keep up!), get resume reviews,
          schedule mock interviews with me, or just play video games. No pressure to join in, and I
          appreciate your support a ton no matter what! <br />
          In terms of where I am on the internet (and off), you might have seen me in
          <a href="https://www.glamour.com/gallery/top-new-women-leaders-in-technology"
            >Glamour Magazine</a
          >

          <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/detail/B07L6S92HG/">Big Dream documentary</a>
          a few years back, or more recently you might have seen my

          project in a couple dozen different publications! I also made a successfully funded

            >Kickstarter project called Go: On the Go!</a
          >
          to get people interested in playing the game Go. I've spoken at over a hundred events
          around the world, and have made online classes on
          <a href="https://scrimba.com/teachers/cassidoo">Scrimba</a>,
          <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/cassidywilliams/">Udemy</a>,

          and moooore. I'll (likely) happily speak at your event or podcast, or do influencer work
          for your org. I have a
          <a href="https://github.com/cassidoo/talks/blob/master/speaker-rider.md">speaker rider</a
          >, if you'd like to talk to me about your event. Feel free to
          <a href="mailto:cassidy@cassidoo.co">email me</a> with details! <br />
          Alright, since you've read this far, have a joke: Why are mountains so funny? Because
          they're hill areas.

          impulse to soar." She loves mechanical keyboards and karaoke.
