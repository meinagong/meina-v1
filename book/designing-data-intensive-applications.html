            <p>Reliablity means making systems work correctly, even when faults occur. Note that a fault is not
              the same as a failure. A fault is usually defined as one componet of the system deviating from
              its spec, whereas a <em>failure</em> is when the system as a whole stops providing the required
              service to the user.

              Scalability means having strategies for keeping performance good, even when load increaes.
            </p>

              Maintainability has many facets, but in essence it's about making life better for the engineering
              and operation teams who need to work with the system.

              In a web browser, using declarative CSS styling is much better than manipulating styles imperatively in JavaScript. Similarly, in databases,
              declarative query languages like SQL turned out to be much better than
              imperative query APIs.
