      Reliablity means making systems work correctly, even when faults occur. Note that a fault is not
      the same as a failure. A fault is usually defined as one componet of the system deviating from
      its spec, whereas a <em>failure</em> is when the system as a whole stops providing the required
      service to the user. <br />

      Scalability means having strategies for keeping performance good, even when load increaes. <br />

      Maintainability has many facets, but in essence it's about making life better for the engineering
      and operation teams who need to work with the system.
