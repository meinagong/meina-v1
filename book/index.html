          Reliablity means making systems work correctly, even when faults occur. Note that a fault is not 
          the same as a failure. A fault is usually defined as one componet of the system deviating from 
          its spec, whereas a <em>failure</em> is when the system as a whole stops providing the required
          service to the user. <br />
          
          Scalability means having strategies for keeping performance good, even when load increaes. <br />
          
          Maintainability has many facets, but in essence it's about making life better for the engineering
          and operation teams who need to work with the system.
